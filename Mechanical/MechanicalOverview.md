# Mechanical Overview
This file gives an overview of the mechanical design of the PiRouette, with relevant links

## Update August 3, 2021
Figure 1 below shows the first iteration of the controller and main body. As of right now, the CAD exists as two hollow shells; one each for the controller and the main chassis. I have not yet blocked off the requisite space for ports, circuit boards, or and wires, etc.

At this point, I am mainly interested in the ergonomics of the controller; as that will probably be the first large hurdle to jump over. I test printed the controller OML over the weekend, and discovered that the controller is wider than I had thought. Additionally, the buttons are too far from the edge of the controller for a comfortable grip. Last, the bump on the rear side of the controller is too shallow; it is uncomfortable to grip when it is that shallow.

Below is the first iteration of the controller OML. The controller CAD is physically split in two to facilitate 3D-printing. There is an alignment part that sticks into the main body of the PiRouette (the upside-down 'U'-shaped part). I also have the buttons around the hole that the joystick will go into. I noticed that it will be hard to press the left and down buttons when the joystick is installed, so I will adjust their layout to be easier to press in the next iteration.
