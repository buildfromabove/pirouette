# Mechanical Overview
This file gives an overview of the mechanical design of the PiRouette, with relevant links

## Update August 3, 2021
Figure 1 below shows the first iteration of the controller and main body. As of right now, the CAD exists as two hollow shells; one each for the controller and the main chassis. I have not yet blocked off the requisite space for ports, circuit boards, or and wires, etc.

**Figure 1** The first iteration of the controller and main chassis OML's. 

At this point, I am mainly interested in the ergonomics of the controller; as that will probably be the first large hurdle to jump over. I test printed the controller OML over the weekend, and discovered that the controller is wider than I had thought. Additionally, the buttons are too far from the edge of the controller for a comfortable grip. Last, the bump on the rear side of the controller is too shallow; it is uncomfortable to grip when it is that shallow.
