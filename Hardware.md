# Hardware

This file goes over the commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware that I am using. I sort it generally into two categories: Systems, and Components. Systems are complex components such as chips and modules. Components are simple items such as diodes, capacitors, and resistors.

## COTS Systems
#### Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4
The CPU and GPU of the PiRouette are the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4.
As of right now, I only have a 1GB CM4 Lite without Bluetooth or WiFi, the literal base model of the CM4. 
[Here](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4782) is a link to the Adafruit listing that I got it from. 

#### Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 IO Board
For evaluation purposes, I have a CM4 IO Board. I also got it at Adafruit. [Here](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4787) is the link.
